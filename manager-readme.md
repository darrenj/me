# Manager README - Darren Jefford

## About This Document

This README is designed to help you understand how I work, what you can expect from me, and what I expect from you. It's a living document that will evolve as we work together. Think of it as a user guide to working with me—not a replacement for getting to know each other, but a head start.

## About Me

I'm Darren, I've spent 25+ years in software engineering roles, some of which were hybrid software engineering and program management. Last 3 years at THG, then 20 years at Microsoft, Siemens, and various startups. I'm passionate about building durable software products that exceed end-users expectations. I live in Bath, Somerset. Married with 2 (grown up children) and 2 Cocker Spaniels.

I've had the privilege of working on innovative, ground-breaking projects for organisations like THG, BBC, BMW, Coca Cola, Met Police, and Nationwide Building Society. I've led teams ranging from small squads to 200+ engineers, and I take pride in the careers I've helped accelerate along the way.

I'm a hands-on technical leader who still loves diving into the code where appropriate, but I'm equally comfortable helping define the business strategy and really understand the user needs. I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the technical possibilities and the human problems we're trying to solve.

## My Role as I See It

My job is to:
- **Set clear direction and context**: You should understand not just what we're building, but why
- **Predictable, high quality software delivery**: Help build a highly functioning engineering organisation that is known for high quality, predictable delivering supporting the wider business strategy
- **Remove blockers**: I'm here to help understand, challenge and find creative ways through blockers enabling us to do our best work
- **Product management**: Building, strong partnerships with Product Management where we build empathy for end-user needs and their priorities whilst ensuring the engineering perspective is fully understood
- **Supporting your growth**: Through coaching, and helping enable new stretch opportunities whilst supporting closely
- **Creating space for autonomy**: I'll set ambitious goals and guardrails, but trust you to find the best path but I'm here to help.
- **Championing your success**: Ensuring you get the recognition you deserve, both internally and externally

## My Leadership Philosophy

### User-Centric Approach
I care deeply about **why we're building something**. What problem are we solving for the user? I believe in spending time with end-users or SMEs wherever possible to learn firsthand about their challenges. Helps me break down what truly needs to be built (and why) versus what might be being asked for. This is where we can evaluate innovative, new ways of solving problem versus the established status quo.

### Trust & Ownership
I believe in ownership—if you see a problem, you have the power to help solve it. I'll set ambitious goals but won't dictate execution. I trust the team to find the best path, though I'm happy to roll up my sleeves and dive into details when helpful. Tell me to back off if I get carried away!

### Challenge the status quo
I will (respectfully!) challenge assumptions and use curiosity and techniques like the [Five Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) to uncover different ways of working, or innovative new ways to solve problems. I encourage you to do the same.

### Transparency & Context
It's important for everyone to understand the "why" behind organisational/roadmap changes. I'll share as much context as possible when these happen.

### Embrace Experimentation
I encourage experimentation through spikes and MVPs, ideally testing with real-world users throgh A/B testing. Let's prove value quickly before scaling. I expect teams to iterate fast and deliver meaningful outcomes where possible.

## Communication & Availability

### Communication Preferences
- **Teams/IM** : Great for quick updates and keeping in touch
- **Email**: Better for longer-form content
- **Documents**: For complex problems, I love a short document (typically a maximum 1 page) framing the topic and suggesting ways forward that we can use as a pre-read ahead of a call or face-to-face meeting

### Open Door Policy
I have an **open-door policy** and will provide regular [office hour](https://www.atteline.com/the-power-of-office-hours/) time for everyone across my teams. 

If you need me, I'm available. Don't hesitate to reach out at any time *regardless* of where you sit across my teams.

### Decision Making & Communication

I believe in transparency around decisions. You deserve to understand not just what decisions are made, but why they're made and what factors were considered.

**What you can expect from me:**
- I'll always communicate decisions with their rationale
- I'll share as much wider context as possible—even when it's messy or uncertain
- I'll explain the constraints and trade-offs we faced
- If a decision changes, I'll explain why

**If I fail to do this, please call me out.** Sometimes in the rush of things, I might forget to close the loop or provide context. A simple "Hey Darren, can you share more context on X?' is always welcome and appreciated.

### Response Times
I *don't* expect real-time responses to everything, but I do ask that we close the loop on everything we open. If something's going to take time, just let me know.

### No Surprises
If something looks like it might become an issue, give me a heads-up at the earliest opportunity. Early visibility means I can potentially offer insight or help before things escalate.

### 1:1s

1:1s with my direct reports are time for **you** and **your agenda**. I'll maintain a running document that we collaborate on and helps feed into performance reviews throughout the year.

I typically use 1:1s to:
- Check in on how you're doing
- Understand what you need from me
- Discuss team issues or concerns
- Explore broad strategy questions
- Feedback for me, how N can help support?

### Skip-Level 1:1s

If you report to someone who reports to me, we'll have regular skip-level 1:1s. These are incredibly valuable for everyone involved, and **managers should not feel uncertain about these conversations**.

**Why I do skip-levels:**
- To spot patterns or systemic issues early
- To maintain connection with the broader organisation
- To understand the health of wider teams

These happen roughly every quarter, but I'm always available if something urgent comes up.

## What I Expect From You

- **Take ownership**: You have the power to make decisions and drive outcomes
- **Entire lifecycle**: We as engineers, not only write the software, but are responsible for testing it (in partnership with testers) and it's ongoing support once deployed into live
- **Communicate openly**: If there's a problem, concern, or better way, I want to hear it  
- **Be curious & challenge assumptions**: Ask "why?" and think critically  
- **Act with urgency & purpose**: Deliver value quickly and iterate from there  
- **Invest in your growth**: Seek learning opportunities and take on challenges  
- **Close the loop**: Follow through on commitments and keep me informed  

## My Quirks & Things to Know

- I have a strong bias for action. I believe progress is made by getting things into users' hands quickly so expect me to push on opportunities to enable this, especially when faced with a long delivery timescale
- It's totally file to say "I don't know" but do expect curiosity and initiative to go find out and let me know how I can support
- I love data and will often ask for metrics to support decisions
- I get excited about technical details and might dive deep, it's **not** that I don't trust you, I'm just curious!
- End-to-end Observability across the whole product is a fundamental, non-negotiable principle for me. I had my fingers burnt many years ago when inheriting a complex, mission critical product suffering from significant operational issues that had almost no telemetry!

## Career Growth & Development

I take career development seriously. I'm proud of the people whose careers I've helped accelerate and those who've chosen to return to my teams. I believe growth comes from:
- Taking on new challenges
- Learning from failures (fail fast, learn faster)
- Exposure to different parts of the business
- Building both depth and breadth of skills

Let's talk regularly about your career aspirations and how we can work towards them.

## Work-Life Balance & Boundaries

### Permission to Disconnect

You have my explicit **encouragement** to disconnect. When you're off, be off. When you're done for the day, close the laptop. Your wellbeing directly impacts your ability to do great work, and I need you at your sustainable best, not your exhausted worst.

**What this means in practice:**
- I don't expect responses to messages outside working hours
- If I send something late or at the weekend, it's because that's when I had time to think about it, not because I expect an immediate response
- "I'll look at this tomorrow/Monday" is a perfectly acceptable response
- If something is truly urgent, I'll state this up-front and we'll work together to figure out how who and how can help.

### Setting Healthy Boundaries

Building great products is a marathon, not a sprint. I've seen too many brilliant engineers burn out because they couldn't switch off. Here's how I'll support your boundaries:

- **Protect your focus time** - Block out deep work time in your calendar. I'll respect it
- **Life happens** - Need to pick up kids, walk the dog, deal with life? Do it. Just keep us informed
- **Sustainable pace** - If you're regularly working more than your contracted hours, let's talk. Either we have a resourcing issue or unrealistic expectations

### When Boundaries Get Blurry

Sometimes we do have genuine emergencies or critical deadlines. When this happens:
- I'll be explicit about why it's urgent and what the impact is
- We'll discuss how to recover afterwards (time off in lieu, reduced load, etc.)
- It should be rare, if it's becoming regular, we need to fix something

## Final Thoughts

This document is a starting point, not a contract. As we work together, we'll both learn and adapt. I'm always open to feedback on how I can better support you and the team and please tell me if I deviate from this readme too much!

Remember: we're all here to build great products that solve real problems. Let's have fun doing it together.
